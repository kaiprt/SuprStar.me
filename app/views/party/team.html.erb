    <h2>Our Story</h2>

    <p> SuprStar is a web based and mobile interactive application that allows users to sing karaoke at ease by allowing you to host your own party anywhere and anytime. We were inspired by the DevBootcamp tradition of tri-weekly karaoke and aimed to simplifiy the process so anyone could enjoy the party.
